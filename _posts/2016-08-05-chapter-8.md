# A function with emoji

Today, we are going to write a function named `emoji=` that returns an emoji:

1. ðŸ˜ƒ  when two things are equal
2. ðŸ˜¡  when two things are not equal



~~~klipse
(def emoji= #(if (= %1 %2) (quote ðŸ˜ƒ ) (quote ðŸ˜¡)))
~~~

~~~klipse
(emoji= (* 2 2) 4)
~~~

~~~klipse
(emoji= (* 2 3) 7)
~~~
