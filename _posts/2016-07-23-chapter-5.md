<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna ask you two different requests:
<br/>
<br/>

1. Please, tell me what's your name
2. Please, tell me "what's your name"

Do you see the difference between the two requests?

To request #1, you will answer by telling me your name: John, Emily, Sandra, David...

And to request #2, you will answer by telling: "what's your name".

The difference is that in request #2, there are quotes.

# The quote operation

Until now, we learned how to tell the computer to evaluate expressions, like this:

~~~klipse
(+ 3 4)
~~~

If we want the computer to display expressions exactly as they are, we use the `quote` operation, like this:

~~~klipse
(quote (+ 3 4))
~~~

Feel free to play with the box below and ask the computer to quote any expression that you want

~~~klipse
()
~~~

You can quote even expressions that have no sense, for example using variables that don't exist:


~~~klipse
(quote (a b c))
~~~


The only restriction is that the expression that you want to quote must be valid.

For instance, the following expression doesn't work because the parentheses are not balanced:

~~~klipse
(quote (+ 3 4 ())
~~~

And this one doesn't work because `12.1.2` is not a valid number:

~~~klipse
(quote (12.1.2))
~~~

Can you think about other invalid expressions?


~~~klipse
()
~~~
