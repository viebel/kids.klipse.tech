In the [previous chapter]({% post_url 2016-06-19-programming-kids-3 %}), you have learned to give names to expressions.

Until now, you have learned how to tell the computer to evaluate one expression. If you write several expression inside a box, the computer will display only the result of the last expression. 

For instance, in this box:

~~~klipse
(+ 3 4)
(* 7 8)
~~~

The computer displays only the result of the evaluation of `(* 7 8)`.


In this chapter, you are going to learn how to tell the computer to display the result of several expressions. In computer language, it is called a `list` of expression.

# A new friend: list

In order to tell the computer to evaluate several expressions, you need to use the operation named `list` and as the operands the expressions that you want to evaluate.


(You see, even when you tell the computer to evaluate several expressions, you write an expression. It is a bit confusing. Right?) 

For that, we need to use the 3 steps of an expression:

1. parentheses
2. the name of the operation: `list`
3. the operands: the expressions that we want to evaluate


For instance, let's tell the computer to display the evaluation of `(+ 3 4)` and `(* 7 8)`:


~~~klipse
(list
  (+ 3 4)
    (* 7 8))
~~~


Now, try to display the evaluation of `(+ 3 4)` and `(* 7 8)` and `(+ 9 8)`.



# list of lists

Now, how would you tell the computer to display several lists?

Simply like this:

~~~klipse
(list
  (list
      (+ 3 4)
          (* 7 8))

    (list (+ 6 5)
            (* 8 3)))

~~~


And of course, inside a list, you can mix lists and numbers.

Like this:

~~~klipse
(list
  (list
      (+ 3 4)
          (* 7 8))
  
    1 4 9)
~~~

C. Display the ages of your siblings (or friends)


~~~klipse
()
~~~


D. Display the age differences between you and your siblings (or friends)


~~~klipse

E. Display two lists:

1. the ages of your siblings
2. the odd numbers between 1 and 10
